<para>This will be a user-friendly implementation of the classic game of sudoku that you can play in your terminal. As such, it will be all text-based, but should be extremely easy to play. More in-depth explanations as far as how to play the game will be provided, assuming I remember to do so (I&apos;m currently going through graduate school, so it&apos;s very likely that I&apos;ll forget to update this or will go long stretches of time without any updates).</para>

<title>Status update: 31 January 2023</title>
<para>Games can now be saved both when the in-game menu is and isn&apos;t enabled. I&apos;ve also made some other minor adjustments to the in-game menu display.</para>
<para>Next is adding the ability to resume games. This will (hopefully) be the last difficult left to do. After that, it should just be cleaning up some leftover TODOs. </para>
